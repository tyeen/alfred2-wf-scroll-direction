# Alfred 2 workflow Scroll Direction
Alfred 2 workflow to show and change the scroll direction of OS X.

If you're using both trackpad and mouse (as me), and prefer different scroll direction for them,
this tool maybe fit for you.

###Note
This workflow has only been tested under OS X 10.9 Mavericks.
I think it should work on 10.8.x or 10.7.x :)

## Installation
You can download the [Scroll Direction.alfredworkflow](https://github.com/tyeen/alfred2-wf-scroll-direction/raw/master/Scroll%20Direction.alfredworkflow) and import to Alfred 2.

Or you can `git clone` or `fork` this repository.

## Usage
### 1. Check the current scroll direction.
Just type the keyword `scrolldirection` to check the current scroll direction.
> Be comfortable to change the keyword to what you like after importing this workflow:)

### 2. Change the scroll direction.
After typing `scrolldirection` you can add a parameter to change the scoll direction:

1. `t` or `trackpad` to set the current scroll direction to 'natural scroll'.

2. `m` or `mouse` to set the current scroll direction to 'anti-natural scroll'.
