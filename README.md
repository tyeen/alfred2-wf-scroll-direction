# Alfred 2 workflow Scroll Direction
Alfred 2 workflow to show and change the scroll direction of System Prefrences on OS X.
> I've only tested on OS X 10.9 Mavericks. I think it should work on 10.8.x or 10.7.x :)

If you're using both trackpad and mouse (as me), and prefer different scroll direction for them,
this tool maybe fit for you.

## Installation
You can download the [Scroll Direction.alfredworkflow](https://github.com/tyeen/alfred2-wf-scroll-direction/raw/master/Scroll%20Direction.alfredworkflow) and import to Alfred 2.

Or you can `git clone` or `fork` this repository.

## Usage
### 1. Check the current scroll direction.
Type the keyword `scrolldirection`.
> Be comfortable to change the keyword to what you like after importing this workflow:)

### 2. Change the scroll direction.
After typing `scrolldirection` you can add a parameter to change the scoll direction:

1. `t` or `trackpad` to set the current scroll direction to 'natural scroll'.

2. `m` or `mouse` to set the current scroll direction to 'anti-natural scroll'.
